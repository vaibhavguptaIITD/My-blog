How to run the test?

1. Open SpecRunner.html. You will see redness all over the screen.
2. There are 4 test cases. 3 for arrays and 1 for flow, located in "spec". Looking at the files one can see 
what is expected of a successful function.
3. Files in "src" contain functions which need to be implemented. The functions have declarations but no 
implementation.
4. Once the functions have been implemented, refreshing SpecRunner.html will show passed/failed functions in 
green/red respectively.
